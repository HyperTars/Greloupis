# Naming Conventions
- We will follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
  - General
    - Avoid using names that are too general or too wordy. Strike a good balance between the two.
    - When using CamelCase names, capitalize all letters of an abbreviation (e.g. HTTPServer).
  - Packages
    - All `lower case`.
    - Use underscore `_` to separate multiple words.
  - Modules
    - All `lower case`.
    - Use underscore `_` to separate multiple words.
    - Preferable to stick to 1 word names.
  - Classes
    - `UpperCaseCamelCase` convention.
    - Python’s built-in classes, however are typically lowercase words.
    - Exception classes should end in “Error”
  - Global (module-level) Variables
    - All `upper case`.
    - Use underscore `_` to separate multiple words.
  - Instance Variables
    - All `lower case`.
    - Use underscore `_` to separate multiple words.
    - Non-public instance variables should begin with a single underscore.
    - If an instance name needs to be mangled, two underscores may begin its name.
  - Methods
    - All `lower case`.
    - Use underscore `_` to separate multiple words.
    - Non-public method should begin with a single underscore.
    - If a method name needs to be mangled, two underscores may begin its name.
  - Method Arguments
    - Instance methods should have their first argument named `self`.
    - Class methods should have their first argument named `cls`.
  - Functions
    - All `lower case`.
    - Use underscore `_` to separate multiple words.
  - Constants
    - Fully `CAPITALIZED`.
    - Use underscore `_` to separate multiple words.


- Models
  - `UpperCaseCamelCase` convention for Model name
  - All `lower case` for content

- DataBase Name conventions
  - Use lowercase: Will help on speed typing, avoid mistakes dues to case sensitivity e.t.c
  - No space – use underscore instead
  - No numbers in name only alpha English characters
  - Valid understandable names like  blog, ecommerce e.t.c but not like project, james, e.t.c
  - Name should be self explanatory
  - Names should not be more than 64 characters.
  - Avoid prefix
