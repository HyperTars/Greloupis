## Scripts

Lots of people nowadays watch videos online. According to our observation, there are three characteristics behind it:

1. Videos are typically transcoded and streamed to users. 

2. Many users not only watch videos, but also want to publish their own videos. Other users can make some interaction, for example posting likes, leaving their comments or simply adding videos to their favorite lists. 

3. Users expect to have easy and clean video watching experience, typically this means that the website UI should be user-friendly, and if possible, free from any annoying advertisement. 

So, based on these points, we designed a great online video platform which satisfies all the needs we mentioned above. Let’s have a look. 

### Search

1. (Top list) When users visit our home page, they will see the top 10 hit videos of the whole website. The sorting index is the video view count, so users can easily know what are the recent trending videos.

2. (Smart Search) Then we talk about search. Simply click on the search button, we will show users all public videos and users. Our search is smart because it can match the keywords with multiple attributes. For example, we can search videos by title, tags, categories and channel. Let’s say we search “shanghai” and we can see that 1 video is matched by video title. We then search “technology” and see that 5 videos are matched because they are all related to technology category.

### User

1. (User create, login, logout) Now let’s create a new user called demoUser… And now we have logged in, since we can visit the user profile page now. The left part is user’s personal information, and the right part is several collections, including uploaded video collections, watched collections, starred collections, etc. Let’s log out and check normal log in function… also works. 

2. We may update some user information. For example lets upload an avatar, and also modify our user status to “public”, so other users can see my profile.

3. And right now, other users can find the new user by searching the information. Let’s open an incognito browser to search. We can see the user right here.

### Video

1. (Video upload) Suppose we want to upload a video now. We have listed all the video format we support, so please ensure that the uploaded video format is in the range. I upload a test video, and click “Publish”. You can see that we have a message box on the top and an upload progress bar below… Let's wait until it gets finished...Now it’s finished. 

2. (Video update) So now, users will be prompted to update the video information immediately. At the same time, our video has been uploaded to AWS and it’s now being transcoded. We need to wait several minutes until the video is ready for streaming. Let’s update some information. Notice that we have tooltips to instruct users how to correctly input information…Then we return to user profile to check our video status. You can see that the video is marked as “pending”, and if we clicked into the video it will show that “the video is being transcoded and cannot be played now”. So we return back. Here we can see that a default video thumbnail image is automatically generated by system, and users can change this image by visiting manage video again. 

3. (Video play 1) Now we see that video status is “public”, which means that video is ready to be played and all users can search this video right now. Click into the video. We can see the information we updated just now. Let’s start to play…	
    1. You can see that we are using video streaming so we will just retrieve part of the video.	
    
    2. We have several control buttons, like play / pause, rewind by 10 seconds, volume control, full screen, and resolution switching. Users can even customize keyboards shortcuts to control videos.

	3. Our website can remember user’s watching process. For example we have now played {number} seconds... Let’s close this video and return back, the video will automatically switches to this number and is ready to be played from here. (We can even try again…)

4. (Video play 2, OP) Now lets talk about video operations. We open another video(Shanghai). Still you can see the video can be played smoothly. Users can post like, dislike, or they can star this video to their collections. They can even write some comments, and of course comments can be deleted afterwards. We now get back to the user profile, and previous operations have been saved.

### Access

We now want to talk about accessibility, because we want to give user enough privacy and also ensure the safety of our website.

1. (User access)  The first part is user access. As mentioned earlier, user can either set status as “public” or “private”. Let’s visit a private user. You can see that only user avatar, name and public videos will be displayed, while other information will be hidden.

2. (Video access) Also video can be set as private, and only video author can see the content. Let’s set our previous uploaded video to “private” and suppose another user is trying to search our private video. No result is matched. And if other users try to directly access by URL, access forbidden error will be returned.

3. (Random access) If users try to randomly access a URL of our website, page not found error will be returned.

### Delete

Finally, if users want to delete a video, they can go to manage video and delete it. But please be careful to do so...Now the video is deleted. 

Users can even delete their accounts. But again, please be careful!
